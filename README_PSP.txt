PSP version features:

1) improved sound fx handling
2) music soundtrack support. I dropped an ogg file from NOIZ2SA as an example; any ogg/s3m/xm/mod file 
can be used, just name it stage.[ogg/xm/s3m/mod] and drop it in the sounds directory.
3) snaphot mode
4) c/c++ source code with makefile profided for those who want to study/improve the game.
5) the game is very much modable: you can create new levels with the windows version editor and edit the
game's graphics.
